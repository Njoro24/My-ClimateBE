## Function 1: Decentralized News & Media Integrity

### 🎯 Purpose
Combat climate misinformation and restore trust in media by verifying the authenticity of climate-related content using real data and community consensus.

### 🔧 How It Works - Step by Step

#### Step 1: Media Upload and Metadata Extraction
```
User uploads climate-related media (photo/video) → System extracts real EXIF data
```

**What happens:**
- Extract GPS coordinates, timestamp, camera information
- Calculate file hash for uniqueness verification
- Analyze image dimensions and quality indicators
- Detect editing software signatures

**Real data used:**
- Actual EXIF metadata from image files
- GPS coordinates validated against known ranges
- Timestamps checked for reasonableness (not future, not too old)

#### Step 2: Source Credibility Assessment
```
System checks uploader's identity → Queries real user database → Calculates credibility score
```

**What happens:**
- Look up user in verified database by email/username
- Retrieve actual trust score (0-100) and verification history
- Convert trust score to credibility factor (0-1)
- Apply bonuses for users with >10 successful verifications

**Real data used:**
- SQLite database with actual user trust scores
- Historical verification accuracy rates
- Community feedback and reputation data

#### Step 3: Geospatial Verification
```
Extract GPS from image → Search for nearby verified climate events → Calculate correlation
```

**What happens:**
- Use GPS coordinates from image metadata
- Query database for verified climate events within 50km radius
- Calculate distance using coordinate mathematics
- Assess temporal correlation (events within reasonable timeframe)

**Real data used:**
- Database of verified climate events with GPS coordinates
- Historical event patterns and locations
- Temporal correlation analysis

#### Step 4: Cross-Reference with Climate Database
```
Analyze image content claims → Compare with verified events → Identify supporting/contradicting evidence
```

**What happens:**
- Extract event type keywords (drought, flood, locust, etc.)
- Search verified events database for matching patterns
- Identify contradictory evidence (e.g., "no drought" vs verified drought events)
- Calculate evidence strength based on number and quality of matches

**Real data used:**
- Verified climate events from Climate Witness Chain database
- Event descriptions and impact assessments
- Economic loss documentation

#### Step 5: Authenticity Score Calculation
```
Combine all factors → Apply weighted algorithm → Generate final authenticity score
```

**Formula:**
```
Authenticity Score = (Metadata Integrity × 0.35) + (Source Credibility × 0.40) + (Technical Analysis × 0.25)

Where:
- Metadata Integrity: GPS validity + timestamp reasonableness + camera info
- Source Credibility: User trust score + verification history
- Technical Analysis: Manipulation detection + quality assessment
```

#### Step 6: Explanation Generation
```
Analyze decision factors → Generate audience-appropriate explanation → Provide evidence links
```

**What happens:**
- Create citizen-friendly explanation in simple language
- List specific evidence found (nearby events, user history)
- Provide confidence factors and reasoning chain
- Suggest next steps or recommendations

### 📊 Real Data Integration Examples

**Example 1: Authentic Drought Photo**
```
Input: Photo from Turkana County showing dried livestock
GPS: 3.1167°N, 35.6167°E (Turkana County)

2. User has high trust score (85/100) ✓
3. Found 3 verified drought events within 50km ✓
4. Timestamp reasonable (recent, not future) ✓
5. No editing software detected ✓

Result: Authenticity Score: 0.89 (HIGH CONFIDENCE)
```

**Example 2: Misinformation Detection**
```
Input: Claim "There is no drought in Kenya, climate change is fake"
Location: Turkana County
Timeframe: Last 30 days

Process:
1. Search database for drought events in Kenya ✓
2. Found 15 verified drought events in last 30 days ✓
3. Detected denial keywords: "no drought", "fake" ✓
4. Cross-referenced with government weather data ✓

Result: Misinformation Detected (Confidence: HIGH)
